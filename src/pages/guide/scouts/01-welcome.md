Life as a Scout is an eye-opening adventure. Scouting exists to actively engage and support young people in their 
personal development, empowering them to make a positive contribution to society.

The Scout section is the third section in the Scout Group, following Beavers and Cubs, for young people aged between 
10½ and 14 years old. 

In their Troops, Scouts make friends with like-minded young people from all walks of life. Together, they will earn 
badges and awards by taking part in both indoor and outdoor activities.

When Scouts join they are 'invested' – making a promise to do their best and help others. Find the various versions 
of the Scout Promise on page 6.
