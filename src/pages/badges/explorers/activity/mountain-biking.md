To achieve this badge you need to choose between Options 1 and 2, then complete all the tasks under your chosen option. You should aim to spend between 6 to 12 months working towards this badge.

## Option 1: competition and exhibition

1. Regularly participate in a mountain biking discipline such as downhill, dirt jump, four cross (4X) or any other mountain bike sport as 
1. agreed by the leadership team. Show how you’ve improved over time and show evidence of this.
1. Talk to a group of young people about the skills and techniques of your chosen discipline.
1. Talk to an appropriate adult about the safety rules in mountain biking and how to use the skills you’ve learned responsibly.
1. Take part in at least two competitions or demonstrations.  Talk about your performance and ways you could improve with the examiner or instructor.

## Option 2: expedition

1. Show that you understand the Mountain Bike Code of Conduct.
1. Show that you are able to control your bike over different types of 
1. terrain.
1. Explain what to do in case of an accident. Ensure you have a basic knowledge of first aid, including how to treat hypothermia.
1. Read a map well and orientate it using map features or a compass.
1. Give reasonable estimates of times of transit, over distances in different 
1. terrains.
1. Plan and carry out a two-day ride with at least four hours’ riding each day. At least 75 per cent of the ride must be off-road, with a minimum of 50 per cent on unsurfaced tracks.
1. Be able to perform emergency repairs in the field as listed for a T1 Mountain Bike Permit.

You don’t need to follow expedition conditions to complete option 2 – you only need to carry emergency equipment and you don’t need to camp out under canvas. You will, however, need an Event Passport or to be accompanied by a leader with a Nights Away Permit.
