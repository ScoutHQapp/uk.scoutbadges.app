1. Learn how to prevent and treat the effects of extreme heat (sunstroke and dehydration) and cold (hypothermia).
1. Demonstrate different techniques to light a fire.
1. Show how to build several different types of fire.
1. Demonstrate the correct use of international distress signals using a whistle, torch, mirror or markers.
1. Describe some basic actions you can take while waiting to be rescued that will keep you and your group safe, and assist your rescuers in locating you.
1. Learn the techniques involved in catching your food, such as fishing or snares. Remember – your leader will want to ensure you’re aware of the law and the issues about inhumanity to animals outside of a real survival situation.
1. Learn to identify and source local, edible plants and fruit and the risks involved in eating those incorrectly identified.
1. Prepare meat such as rabbit or fish to cook over an open fire and eat.
1. Make an item of equipment that will be of use to you on a survival exercise.
1. Demonstrate methods of filtering and purifying water.
1. Demonstrate methods of finding direction by day or night without a compass.
1. Finally, with a group of at least three other Explorers, take part in a survival exercise lasting two nights. The group should:
	* construct a shelter of natural or salvaged materials and sleep in it
	* cook all meals over an open fire
	* cook without utensils or aluminium foil (although a knife may be used).


Snaring legislation is dependent on National location, so please ensure you know the relevant laws, best practices and required tags/registrations. Where you are not familiar with snaring practices it may be better to have an expert run this activity with your section. As with all Scouting activities, a thorough risk assessment should take place before carrying out the activity. Further information can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/hunting/overview) and additional information is available for those in [Scotland](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Environment/Wildlife-Habitats/management/snaring-training).
