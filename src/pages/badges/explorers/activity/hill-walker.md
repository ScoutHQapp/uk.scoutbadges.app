Before you attempt this badge you need to hold the Scout section Hill Walker Activity Badge or have completed at least five one-day journeys in the hills, each one at least 14 kilometres’ distance.

1. Take a major part in planning and successfully managing at least four one-day journeys, two of which must be in terrain two areas. A person with an activity permit must accompany or supervise the journeys.
1. Play a major part in the planning, preparation and leadership of at least one two-day expedition, involving overnight camping in wild country. You must prepare by demonstrating the correct use of all essential equipment. A person with an activity permit can supervise the expeditions but you will take in part in decisions affecting navigation and party management.

All journeys and the expedition should have a defined purpose, like reaching a summit  or completing a trail – so not just walking some distance.
