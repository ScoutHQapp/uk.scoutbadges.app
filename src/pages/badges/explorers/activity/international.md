Complete four of these activities:

* Showcase a form of art or culture from another country. You could create a display of art you have researched or created yourself, or put on a cultural performance.
* Participate in an event with an international theme. Discuss your experience with your Unit.
* Choose a country and explore their traditions and culture around food and dining. Recreate a dining experience relating to your chosen country for your leaders, parents or another section.
* Take part in an international Scouting experience such as an international jamboree, setting up an international link, or a Jamboree on the Air (JOTA)-Jamboree on the Internet (JOTI) event.
* Organise an activity for your Unit or a younger section that explores another country's national celebration, festival or event (eg. Mela, Republic Day India, Chinese New Year)
* Explore aspects of another country's culture such as their greetings, religion and approach to gender. You could play a cultural simulation game or discuss the similarities and differences with culture in the UK.
