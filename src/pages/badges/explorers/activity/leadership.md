1. Successfully lead  a team of Explorers throughout the course of a project. There are lots of possibilities but whatever you do, youâ€™ll need 
to:
	* set a goal for the project and individual targets for team members
	* take suggestions and feedback from team members into account and act on them
	* teach team members new skills that may be required for the project
	* manage any tricky situations or people and find compromises
	* give clear instructions, motivate your team, give praise, ensure that you are on track and make sure everyone is safe.
2. Take an active role in the running of an activity linking with the Scout section. Help a new Explorer Scout to be part of the Unit and help  them understand what is expected.
3. Help a group of Explorers or members of a younger section develop a Scouting skill.
4. Represent the views of other Explorer Scouts (for example at a District Explorer Scout Forum or similar) and report back to them afterwards.
