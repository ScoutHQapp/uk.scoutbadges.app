1. Find out about an international charity; what do they do and why is it important? Your chosen charity could support global issues such as water and sanitation, poverty, refugees and disaster relief.
1. Monitor the waste you produce as a Cub Pack and make a plan to reduce, reuse and recycle your Pack's waste.
1. Take part in an international awareness day or week.
1. Think about what you would need to survive if you became homeless because of a disaster, like flooding or an earthquake. Decide what your five most important things would be and discuss with your Cub Pack.
1. Identify five belongings of yours that have come from other countries. Point out the countries on a map. Talk to others about why your belongings have come from so far away.

## Top tips

* For number 1, you could invite a guest speaker to your group to tell you about an international charity. For example WaterAid and Volunteer Services Overseas have local speaker networks that could come and visit.
* For number 3, you could take part in World Water Day (March), Refugee Week (June), World Environment Day (June) or World Toilet Day (October). You can find more information on the United Nations website here.
