## Top tips

Your leader will award you the Athletics badge for taking part and doing your best. Take this chance to see how well you can do!

For number 1, your routine might involve: skipping, running on the spot, stretching both arms high above your head and then relaxing down, bending your knees and dropping your head, rolling your head slowly around, and tensing and relaxing the shoulders.

You could gain the Athletics badge by taking part in a sports day in your Pack or the District, so long as it includes the activities we’ve listed.

**For the high jump, you must be very careful about the way you jump. You also need special equipment and crash mats for your landing. You must not try to do the Fosbury Flop unless you’ve been taught how to do it properly and an expert is there to watch you.**
