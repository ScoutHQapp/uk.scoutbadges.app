## Top tips

For the sargent jump, the person checking your score will get you to stand straight against the measure, with your arm stretched up. They will then adjust the measure so it starts from the tips of your fingers. The measurements depend on how high you can hit the measure with a jump. There are videos online that show how it's done.

For the shuttle run, the limits of the run will be marked on the ground. To finish the run, your hand or foot must touch on, or past, the mark. 

For the 4 x 100 metre relay race, the timings listed are for a team of four to complete the whole distance.
