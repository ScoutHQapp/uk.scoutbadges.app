	* the important or sacred objects
	* the festivals and customs
	* the stories and traditions. These could be from books, videos or other places.
2. Choose a favourite prayer or reading. You could even write the prayer yourself. Share it with the Pack at a time thatâ€™s good for everyone. Explain to the Pack why you like it and what it means to you.
3. Choose your favourite festival. Explain what it celebrates or means and talk about the food, clothes and customs associated with the festival.
