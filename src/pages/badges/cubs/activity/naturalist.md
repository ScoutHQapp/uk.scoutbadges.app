1. Learn how to identify six different living things from two of these 
categories:
	* trees
	* garden birds
	* water birds
	* minibeasts and insects
	* wild flowers
	* pond dwellers
	* fungi
	* butterflies and moths

	That means you should have 12 examples in total. 

2. Over three months, visit the same natural area at least four times. Take a note of the changes in the plants and wildlife that you see. You might visit a garden, hedgerow, canal, river lake or park. Make sure that you have an adultâ€™s permission for the visits.
3. Learn the countryside code and how to follow it.
4. Choose one of these activities to do:
	* Create a piece of art using natural material. You could do a bark or leaf rubbing, dried flower picture or maybe a collage.
	* Use a dye that uses natural ingredients to colour a piece of material.
	* Make a feeding station for birds. Get permission to hang it in a good position.
	* Make a hedgehog, ladybird or bee house.
	* With an adult pick wild edible berries, leaves or fruit. Use them in a recipe.
 
**For number 2, it must be agreed with an adult that a young person can visit a natural area. They must know where a young person is and how long they arr going to be.**

**When picking plants or berries for number 4, make sure you are 100% sure you know what it is and whether it's safe to eat. If you're not sure, don't eat it.**
