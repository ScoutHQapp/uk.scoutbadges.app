Do six science activities. You should choose at least one from each of these sections.  

For each one, explain or show your leader what you did and what you found out.

## Section 1: reactions

* Show how vinegar reacts with different items and explain what happens. The different items could be steel wool, sodium bicarbonate or old dirty coins.
* Find out what happens when you add salt to water.
* Compare the density of water to the density of other liquids. Show how these liquids react to each other.
* Make a pH indicator solution. Use it to test the acidity or alkalinity of other liquids.
* Grow crystals.
* Another activity agreed with your leader

## Section 2: interacting with energy

* Create a basic electrical circuit that includes a switch. Show how it could be used to control a lightbulb powered by a battery.
* Make an air-powered balloon rocket or a water rocket. Investigate ways of improving how far it can travel.
* Make a simple compass. Show the effects of metallic and magnetic materials upon it.
* Use marshmallows and spaghetti to build the strongest tower you can. Explain how you improved your design.
* Find a way to show that hot air rises.
* Another activity agreed with your leader

## Section 3: living things

* Set up a wormery or ant colony. Record what happens over three or four weeks
* Investigate what happens to your pulse rate before, during and after exercise.
* Grow cress, beans, peas or a similar plant. Investigate what happens when the plant has no access to light. What happens when it has light, 
* but no water?
* Find a way to show that plants take water up through their stems.
* Make some yoghurt and find out how living organisms are involved in 
* the process.
* Another activity agreed with your leader
