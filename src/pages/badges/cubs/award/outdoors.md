	* show that you know how to keep your tent and kit safe, tidy and secure
	* cook a meal with your Six
	* build a shelter big enough for two Cubs
	* using bamboos canes, rubber bands or simple lashings complete a simple pioneering project or make a camp gadget
	* learn and follow the Countryside Code
	* show you know what things you need to do to look after your campsite, and that you can put them into practise
	* show that you know how to treat mild burns, scalds, cuts or grazes and make a call to the emergency services.

	* take part in a wide game
	* take part in a campfire sing-along or other entertainment
	* cook a backwoods meal
	* build a bivouac and sleep in it
	* care for your personal equipment while at camp
