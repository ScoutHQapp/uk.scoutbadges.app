> These badge requirements were updated on 26 January 2018. The previous badge requirements can still be used until 31 January 2019, to allow for transition where necessary.

1. Do three experiments. Talk to your leader about trying these:
	* white light spinners
	* magnet tricks
	* making a ketchup packet sink
	* sensory bottles
	* volcano eruption
	* making slime
	* growing cress
	* rainbow flowers

	Before you try them, what do you think might happen?

2. After you do your experiments, tell other Beavers what you saw and discovered. Try to explain why it happened.
