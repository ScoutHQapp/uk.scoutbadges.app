1. Learn how to care for an animal. Find out what the animal needs. Learn about its food, habitat, space, exercise and sleeping area.
1. Help to take care of that animal for four weeks.
1. Keep a note of how you have looked after the animal for four weeks. You can draw, take photographs or write short sentences.
1. Tell others in your Colony or Lodge about the animal.

## Top tips

The animal you care for could be a dog, cat, gerbil, guinea pig, fish, bird, rabbit, lamb or even a stick insect! 

This can include the looking after of wild animals such as birds. Caring for them would include feeding them and looking after a bird bath, for example.

Maybe you could help look after a family member’s pet.

Even though there are lots of computer games and things that show you what it’s like to care for an animal, these won’t count for this badge. You will need to learn to take care of a real, live animal.
