A Scout Troop is usually organised into smaller groups called Patrols, each headed up by a Patrol Leader, and often with an Assistant Patrol Leader as well. Some Troops may also have Senior Patrol Leaders.

Senior Patrol Leaders, Patrol Leaders and Assistant Patrol Leaders wear leadership stripes to recognise their roles.
