The badges are numbered,  and you can be awarded a new badge every 12 months from the time you joined Scouting. If you were a member in a previous section, the badge numbers will continue from the ones you have already been awarded.

You collect these badges throughout your time in Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers. They recognise how long you have been a member of the Scout movement in total. You can earn up to four of these badges while youâ€™re a Scout.
