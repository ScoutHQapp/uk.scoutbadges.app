2. Complete one of these activities:
   * By yourself or with another Scout, take photographs or collect pictures of at least 10 different aircraft types. Name the different types and their uses.

3. Complete one of these activities:
   * Recognise and name the national aircraft markings, both service and civil, of at least six countries including the United Kingdom.
   * Learn the RAF and NATO system of letter designation according to aircraft function. Give examples of three designations.
   * Name three basic training aircraft used in private flying. Give a brief report on one, naming a club and airfield where it is used. Try to make it a local airfield, if possible.
