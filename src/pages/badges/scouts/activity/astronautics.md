> These badge requirements were updated on 26 January 2018. The previous badge requirements can still be used until 31 January 2019, to allow for transition where necessary.

1. Find out how craters are formed, and what meteorites tell us about the universe. You could experiment using marbles, rubber balls or stones as meteorites, and a tray filled with sand as your planet/moon surface.  
1. Compare satellite images of Mars and the Moon with satellite images of Earth. Point out similar landscape features such as craters, valleys and volcanoes. Discuss what Earth observation can tell us about the land, sea and atmosphere.
1. Build your own satellite dish. Discuss what everyday items rely on satellites.
1. In a group, debate about life elsewhere in the universe. What might it look like? How do we search for life on other planets and moons? How would the human race react to the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe?
1. Find out about the International Space Station and how astronauts live and work on board.
1. Research a current space mission, such as a mission to Mars. Then, design a model of your own space probe or other spacecraft, including the instruments on board that enable it to complete its mission.
1. Build, launch and recover a model rocket. Think about the shape of your rocket and why thatâ€™s important. Make a second launch to achieve a specific objective, such as reaching a certain height or carrying a fragile payload, like an egg.
