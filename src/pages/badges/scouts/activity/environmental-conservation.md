1. Find out about an environmental  issue that is important to your local community. It might be linked to:
	* recycling and conservation
	* energy efficiency in the home or your meeting place
	* the building of new homes and local land use
	* water, light, thermal, air or beach pollution
	* coastal erosion
	* the impact of tourism on the local environment.
1. Take part in an activity or project that improves local conservation. It could take place during a weekend conservation camp or you could spread it over at least five weekly sessions. You could look at:
	* recycling
	* reducing energy usage or renewable energy
	* protecting important habitats or wildlife
	* pollution
	* erosion
	* flooding.
1. Get involved in a campaign to make others aware of an environmental  issue. You could write to your MP and other local agencies or speak to a community group.
