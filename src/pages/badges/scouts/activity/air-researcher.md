1. Research one historical aspect of flight, and share what you find out with the Troop. You might like to find out about:
	* the development of aviation or flight over a period of time agreed with your leader
	* balloons or airships, from their first appearance to the present day
	* a type of aero engine, such as a jet or piston engines in general, or a specific engine like the Rolls Royce Merlin
	* the development of an aircraft type, like a Spitfire, Boeing 747, Harrier, Stealth Bomber, space shuttle or the Wessex helicopter. You could find out details about its history, role and  achievements.
1. While youâ€™re doing your research, visit at least one place of interest that relates to your chosen subject. It could be a museum, an air display or an aeronautics factory.
1. Present what you have found out. Your presentation should include a model that you have made based on your subject. You should also include diagrams and pictures wherever you can.
