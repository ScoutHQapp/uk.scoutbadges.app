## Top tips

* For number 1 young people might decide to do skipping, running on the spot, stretching both arms high above your head and then relaxing down, bending the knees and dropping the head or rolling the head slowly around, tensing and relaxing the shoulders. 
* For the field events we recommend the shot weigh around 2.73kg, the discus 1kg and the cricket ball 0.135kg

**Young people must be especially careful when doing the high jump. Young people will need to think about the way they jump, how they are going to land and what they are going to land on.**

Proper equipment must be used at all times and unless expert tuition and supervision is available, no young person should attempt the Fosbury Flop. The scissor jump is an easier way to do it.
