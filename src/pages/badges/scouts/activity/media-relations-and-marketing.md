Choose from three of these activities to achieve this badge.

* Produce and give a presentation about Scouting. Use audio and visual media and think about how you can make it relevant to people not involved in Scouting.
* Write a press release about a Scout event that has taken place. Send it to your local Media Development Manager so that they can get it published in the local press, radio station or community website.
* Find out about local media outlets such as radio, TV, newspapers and online. Find out what their target audience is and work out a storyline that they might be interested in featuring.
* Prepare and present an audio or video package about a Scouting event or activity. The report should be accurate, informative and reflect the adventure of Scouting.
* Prepare a creative display about your Troop or Group that can be exhibited in your local library, information centre or public place.
* Interview a local public figure or someone in the local news, such as a church leader, politician or celebrity and present the interview to your Troop. Get some advice from your Leader before contacting the person.
* Produce some media which can be used within Scouting, such as a district newsletter story or a piece of website content.
