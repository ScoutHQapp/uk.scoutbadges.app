> These badge requirements were updated on 26 January 2018. The previous badge requirements can still be used until 31 January 2019, to allow for transition where necessary.

1. Identify where your clothing or other belongings have been made. With other Scouts, talk about why companies might choose to have the items made in other countries. What are the advantages and disadvantages of overseas production?
1. Investigate a recent natural disaster by looking at photos, news articles or videos online. Decide in small groups what five things were needed to help people after the disaster. Decide as a Troop how best you can help when a natural disaster happens.
1. Find out about an international sporting event and discuss with your Troop how sporting events can contribute to international peace and understanding.
1. In small groups, learn about an international health issue and use a creative way to share what you have learnt with your Troop. Issues could include Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Aids.
1. Think about the rights that we have in the UK (like the right to vote, the right to go to school and equal gender rights). Compare these with the rights a Scout in another country might have.
