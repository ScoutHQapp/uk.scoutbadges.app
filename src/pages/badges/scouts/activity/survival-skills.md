1. Show that you know:
	* basic knife or multi-tool skills, including safety and sharpening
	* first aid treatment you may need to use while on a survival event, considering you may have limited resources available
	* how to construct different kinds of shelter
	* how to build a fire and use basic lighting techniques. You should not use man-made materials such as paper or firelighters.
	* the various burning qualities of different woods
	* how to maintain hygiene in a survival situation
	* the correct use of international distress signals, using a whistle, torch, mirror or markers
	* some basic actions to take while waiting rescue that will both keep you (and your group) safe and will assist your rescuers in locating you.
1. Put together a personal survival kit.
1. With a group of at least three Scouts, take part in a survival exercise. It should last about 24 hours and the group should:
	* construct a shelter of natural or salvaged materials and sleep in it
	* prepare a meal using raw ingredients that could have been found or caught
	* cook all meals over an open fire
	* cook without utensils, although you may use a knife.

For number 3, wild mountainous country is not suitable. The nights away scheme rules must be followed.

When working with knives is is recommended to work in small manageable groups of 3-4 scouts to one leader. 


Snaring legislation is dependent on National location, so please ensure you know the relevant laws, best practices and required tags/registrations. Where you are not familiar with snaring practices it may be better to have an expert run this activity with your section. As with all Scouting activities, a thorough risk assessment should take place before carrying out the activity.
