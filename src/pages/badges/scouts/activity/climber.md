1. Show that you know the rope types used for rock climbing. Explain how to coil and maintain them.
1. Show that you know how to fit a climbing helmet and harness and how to tie in correctly.
1. Show you understand the calls used in climbing.
1. Show that you know how to abseil down a face. It should usually be at least 10 metres high. Alternatively, you can take part in a climbing-like activity, such as crate stacking or high ropes, and show you know about the safety equipment used.
1. Take part in four or more separate climbs. Your climbs should either be on artificial walls of grade 4+/5 or natural faces up to ‘difficult’ standard. You could do a mixture of both, using a different route for each climb. Either way, an experienced climber must supervise your climbs and evaluate your ability.
1. Explain the safety rules for climbing on both natural and artificial rock faces.
1. Show that you’re aware of environmental  issues around climbing on atural rock faces.
1. Explain how to care for the equipment you used. Also, explain what you should look out for when equipment is nearing the end of its life.
