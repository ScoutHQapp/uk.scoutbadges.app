If you have been confirmed, had your bat mitzvah or bar mitzvah or a similar faith life experience, you only need to take part in a Scouting activity relating to your faith to qualify for your badge.

Otherwise, hereâ€™s what you need to do.

1. Take an active part in your place of worship. You could get involved in community work, take a special part in services or celebrations or follow a training or study programme.
1. Find out more about the origins of your faith. Share what you find out with others in the Troop.
1. Explore something about the history of your faith at a local, national or international level. You could learn about influential people, or visit a shrine or other holy place.
1. Explain to an adult some of the teachings of your faith. Explain how these affect the way you live your life.
