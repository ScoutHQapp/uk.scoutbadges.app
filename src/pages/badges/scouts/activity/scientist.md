Choose from options 1 or 2, then complete all of the tasks under your chosen option.

## Option 1

1. Explore and discuss the science behind two Scouting activities or hobbies. For example, you could investigate the science behind a perfect campfire, how a kayak stays afloat and travels through the water, or how a compass or GPS device works.

2. Complete one of these:

   * Plan and complete your own experiment to explore the science behind one Scouting activity or hobby. Record your findings and explain what these mean to others. Try thinking of a question you want to answer or something you want to prove.
   * Plan and run an activity, demonstration or presentation to help others understand the science behind a Scouting activity or hobby.

## Option 2

1. Plan and complete three science experiments or activities. You could try making invisible ink, creating an eruption, designing a catapult or putting together a battery. Check your plan with an adult first, then for each experiment:

   * Change something about the experiment or activity and try it again, at least once. Predict what you think will happen and find out if you were right.
   * Show that you understand the science behind your experiment or activity.

2. Find out how one of your experiments or activities links to the real world. Then, explain it to others. For example, if you made a battery, what are batteries usually made from? If you created an eruption, how similar or different is this to how volcanoes erupt?

## CREST Awards

CREST is a STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) enrichment programme and CREST Awards are well regarded by schools, employers and universities.While working towards option 1 of this badge, Scouts could complete a CREST Discovery or Bronze Award by completing a project of at least five or ten hours.
