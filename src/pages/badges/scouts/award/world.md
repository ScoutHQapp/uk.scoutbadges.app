> These award requirements were updated on 26 January 2018. The previous award requirements can still be used until 31 January 2019, to allow for transition where necessary.

1.  Choose an aspect of local community life and find out as much as you can about it. You could learn about:
	* local government
	* local history
	* different faiths and beliefs
	* types of farming/industry found locally

2.  Spend a day volunteering with and finding out about a service in your local community:
	* What are their challenges?
	* Who relies on this service?
	* What positive impact could you have on this service in the future?

	Services could be homeless shelters, local nature reserves, care homes and food banks. 

3.  Take part in an activity that reflects upon and explores your own beliefs, attitudes and values (this may or may not include religious beliefs). What values do we share as Scouts? Which Scout value means the most to you? 

4.  Take part in an activity that explores common beliefs and attitudes towards gender or disability in different societies. You could look at this in the context of music, sport and fashion. 

5.  Take an active part in an environmental project.

6.  Investigate and try to make contact with Scouts in another country. Make sure you and your leader read the International Links Guidance here.

7.  Take part in an activity that explores an international issue.
