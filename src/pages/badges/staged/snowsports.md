## Snowsports - stage 1

1. Identify different types of snowsports.
1. Name three places you could safely take part in snowsport activities.
1. Take part in a warm up activity to prepare you for a snowsport activity such as skiing or snowboarding. This should be an appropriate warm up for your upper, middle and lower body.
1. Dress properly for your chosen activity. Show you know the importance of helmets and how to put one on correctly.
1. Take part in a taster session that covers:
	* naming equipment used
	* how to get in and out of your skis or snowboard
	* balancing on your skis or snowboard
	* moving around on your skis or snowboard; including moving in a straight line, controlling your speed and stopping.

### Top tips

You can do most of these steps without actually taking part in a snowsport activity on either a natural or artificial slope. But we think it's best to do them as part of a practical activity. 

Your leader should be able to find lots of support on the National Governing Body websites for Snowsport England, Snowsport Scotland and Snowsport Cymru Wales.

More support for disability snowsports can be found on the Disability Snowsport UK website.
