These badge requirements were updated on 22 May 2018. The previous badge requirements can still be used until 31 May 2019, to allow for transition where necessary. 

When doing any activity online, make sure you stay safe. You can find guidance on how to stay safe online here.

We are partnering with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, an amazing charity specialising in bringing digital making to people all over the world, to develop these badge requirements, new for May 2018. The new badge requirements move away from abstract concepts to use digital skills to solve problems, build resilience, help their communities and express themselves. Take a look at the Raspberry Pi partner page to find out more.

For the activities currently released for stages 1 and 2, the only technology needed is laptops. WiFi access is not needed in your meeting place, though some preparation will be needed in advance of the session in that case. More activities coming soon, broadening the support for stages 1 and 2, and suggesting activities for stages 3, 4 and 5.

## Digital Maker - stage 1
In stage 1 you will learn what digital making is and how it fits with Scouting and the wider world.

How to earn your badge:

1. Show that you know what a computer is and understand that there are lots of uses for digital technology in everyday life. Think about where you see computer systems and technology in your day-to-day life, and about how digital technology helps make things better or easier.
2. Create a graphic for a computer game, app, or website. This could be a background scene, character, or other image.
3. Write clear instructions for a computer or person to follow to complete a task.

### Top tips

For requirement 2, you could try using a simple drawing tool like the one in Scratch, or use paper and craft materials.
For requirement 3, you could instruct a friend or a computer character to navigate through a maze. If you’ve created a character in requirement 2, you could try writing instructions for them.
Guidance for leaders
Some of the activities require a small number of devices, such as laptops, tablets, or phones; young people should use a device for at least one activity. The more they can get hands-on with technology, the better.

### Suggested activities to help you meet the requirements:

* Requirement 1: [Computers in the real world](http://bit.ly/2IVl3hw)
* Requirement 2: [Create a campsite](http://bit.ly/2LkLfEX)
* Requirement 3: [Compass coding](http://bit.ly/2KMLHuj) (using laptops) or [Compass coding](http://bit.ly/2IBs47Y) (tech free version). 

Watch the videos below to see these activities in action. 

## Digital Maker - stage 2

In stage 2 you will demonstrate that you can complete digital projects which can be used in Scouting activities or in the wider world.

How to earn your badge:

1. Create a piece of interactive or animated digital art using software.
2. Create a simple computer program to help with a scouting activity, and try it out.
3. Make a simple digital creation that uses code to interact with the wider world through inputs (such as buttons or typing on a keyboard) and outputs (such as a computer screen, sound, or lights).

### Top tips

* For requirement 1, you could create a pixel art character with multiple frames, or use the Paint tool in Scratch to create a character with multiple poses.
* For requirement 2, you could use Scratch to make a game that helps you keep score in a wide game, or create a game to count compressions whilst doing CPR for your Emergency Aid Staged Activity Badge for example.
* For requirement 3, you could make a musical instrument or games controller using a Makey Makey, or use conductive play dough to make a simple circuit.
* You could use the digital art you have created in requirement 1 in either your program for requirement 2 or in your digital creation for requirement 3.
The above are only suggestions, and there are lots more things you can try!

### Guidance for leaders

Some of the activities require a small number of devices, such as laptops, tablets, or phones and other low-cost equipment; some don’t need technology. More information coming soon about where to get the right resources.

Suggested activities to help you meet the requirements:

* Requirement 1: Pixel art
* Requirement 2: Leaf identifier

## Digital Maker - stage 3

In stage 3 you will demonstrate that you can use and combine a variety of digital making skills to complete projects that can be used in Scouting activities or in the wider world.

How to earn your badge: 

1. In a coding language of your choice, create a basic program to meet a need of Scouting or your section.
1. Use a programmable device (such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or micro:bit) with electronic components, code, and appropriate materials to create an electronic gadget and use it in a Scouting activity.
1. Design and create digital graphics for use as part of one of the above. The elements of the project should all fit within the project’s specific purpose.
1. Show and present your digital making project, explaining the challenges that you encountered while creating it and how you addressed them.

### Top tips

* For requirement 1, you could create a basic website for your section or a choose-your-own-adventure story on Scratch, a computer program to choose teams for a game or activity, or write a program for encrypting and decrypting secret messages.
* For requirement 2, you could create a micro:bit Morse code compass, or program a robot to avoid obstacles to simulate the search of a disaster area.
* The above are only suggestions, and there are lots more things you can try!

### Guidance for leaders

Access to a programmable device is required. More information coming soon about where to get the right resources.

Suggested activities coming soon.

## Digital Maker - stage 4

In stage 4 you will demonstrate that you can combine a variety of digital making skills to solve a problem or meet a challenge related to Scouting.

How to earn your badge: 

1. Using a combination of programming, digital art, digital devices, electronic components, and other appropriate materials, create something that could serve a purpose in a Scouting activity.
1. Attend a digital making event and show your work, or help somebody else in your section or another section to work towards a Digital Maker Staged Activity badge.

### Top tips

* For requirement 1, you could make a nature camera or weather station for your Scout meeting place and use the data in other Scouting activities.
* For requirement 2, you could take part in a Raspberry Jam, attend a Code Club, attend a hackathon, or visit a Coderdojo.
* You can help others to work towards any stage of their Digital Maker Staged Activity  badge. If you are an Explorer Scout Young Leader, supporting Beavers, Cubs, or Scouts with their Digital Maker activities would count for this requirement.

The above are only suggestions, and there are lots more things you can try! 

### Guidance for leaders

One larger project can be completed to combine all skills, or multiple smaller challenges can be completed. Access to specific devices, components, and materials is likely to be necessary. A section may collaborate on a single project.

Suggested activities coming soon.

## Digital Maker - stage 5

In stage 5, you will combine your digital making skills to identify and solve a real problem in the local or global community. You will go through the process of project design from concept, to testing and implementation, and finally to sharing your new knowledge with others.

How to earn your badge: 

1. Identify a real-life local or global problem and design, build, test, and improve a solution by combining your digital making skills and selecting appropriate software tools, digital devices, components, and materials.
1. Create and share a resource that would allow someone else to replicate your project with minimal previous knowledge. This resource should be digital, and it can be any format you like: a video (or a series!), an online (printable) document, an entry on a tutorials website such as Instructables, a blog post...Or meet with people who could benefit from your solution to share how you created it and explain how it can help them.

### Top tips

For requirement 1, you could develop a digital device that makes a Scouting activity accessible to a young person with a disability, or you could design a low-cost educational kit that would allow young people in developing countries to access digital making.
