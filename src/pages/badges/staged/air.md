Information about flight simulators:

There are free online flight simulators available, which would be sufficient for stage 3.  Examples are listed in this external article.
There are desktop flight simulator programmes available, such as Microsim and X-plane. Due to the cost of these, it would be worth purchasing at District level.
A local aviation/aircraft museum or gliding club may have a flight simulator that you could access, or if you’re an RAF recognised Air Scout groups, you could ask your local ATC unit.
Resources are available through our partnership with Heathrow to support this badge. To download the resources, visit the partner page here. 

Why not find out if your local British Model Flying Association (BMFA) club can offer any support? You can find contact details for your local club here. Or, you can contact the BMFA office at admin@bmfa.org to get in touch with a local club or an Educational Co-ordinator for your area.
